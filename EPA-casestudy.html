      Working with one other teammate, we appreciated the incorporation of accessibility into the site, 
      but the website was lacking personality and missing a brand voice. Also, the website navigation 
      was cluttered and in need of restructuring. The homepage was made up of primarily links which 
      was not particularly engaging. We would like to change the brand voice of the site and make it 
      more personable and inviting with a cleaner interface and easy navigation.<br><br>

      First, we created  a married professional woman looking to relocate from Seattle with her husband 
      and two small children. Lilah’s user scenario: Lilah Shaw and her family are moving to Tustin, CA 
      from Seattle, WA in a couple of months for a new job opportunity for her husband John. The couple 
      has two young children, Abby who is 7, and Jonah who is 3. They are checking out homes on zillow.com 
      and want to find out about the environment of the neighborhood and air quality of the area. They are 
      going to meet with a realtor in a couple of weeks and Lilah is trying to gather all of the information 
      she can before their visit to Southern California. Lilah also wants to check for mold in the homes 
      she is looking at so that she can spot any kind of damage easily in their potential new home.<br><br>

          <p class="card-text"> We conducted an open card sort to help us in creating a newly imagined navigation in order to tackle 
            the information architecture and structure first.  Utilizing this method we were able to synthesize 
            our navigation from 30 items down to 15, cutting it in half and featuring what was important according 
            to our user testing. </p>

            found out that it was extremely confusing for them to navigate to the pages we needed to utilize for 
            our redesign based on the way the site was set up.  We created our new navigation based on the site 
            map we created and the user flow which simplified the tasks we needed to complete.</p>

          <p class="card-text"> We utilized a screen reader test in addition to checking the code for use of alt tags in the 
            descriptions.  We found that the site had done a good job with accessibility, but it was still 
            lacking in a brand voice and an approachable feel.  Our goal was to keep in line with accessibility 
            while creating cleaner navigation and an outdoorsy voice in keeping with the EPA’s mission of 
            protecting the environment.</p>

    <h3>User Testing and Key Findings</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="container px-lg-5">
    <p class="font-weight-normal">Since we wanted to validate and iterate on our designs, our next step was to test our 
      low-fidelity prototype with users that fit our target audience. We created a user testing plan, in which we had laid out 
      3 tasks for the users to perform.</p>
    <div class="col-me-8 py-3 px-lg-5"><img src="images/user-testing.png" class="mx-auto d-block img-fluid" alt="Responsive image"></div>
  </div>
  <div class="container px-lg-5">
    <p class="font-weight-normal">Overall users like the color scheme, images and design system on the new website. It was 
      straight forward for the users to finish the first task of finding the Earth Day activity. For the second task, all 
      the user went to “My Community” section to look for information about “Mold” and then they will look under the 
      “Environmental Topics” and found the topic about “mold”. So the problem goes back to the sitemap and need to rework 
      the sitemap and user flow in order to fix the user confusion.

    <p class="font-weight-normal">Based on what we had learned in the user testing, we made alterations to the low-fidelity 
      screens and moved on to the high-fidelity phase. In this we were going to add a visual layer to our wires and bring the 
      product to life. Here is a small sample of the newly created prototype complete with beautiful images, newly created content 
      and clearer calls to action. This was our first iteration due to time constraints, however, it clearly shows the direction 
      and feel of the rebrand and redesign we created.

    <h3>Key Learning and Takeaways</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="container px-lg-5">
    <p class="font-weight-normal">It was a challenge to restructure the current website and unify the content, apply the new UI elements 
      under a new brand vision. The content structure can make or break a user experience as we tried to chunk the content and use the 
      cards as a secondary navigation, hence to enable our users to scan the page quickly. Tackling the responsive web design can be very challenging,
      how can we enhance our users experiences makes this project a valuable exercise in responsive web design. As a UX/UI  
      designers, when designing for any digital content, it should be accessible across different platforms and orientations.
