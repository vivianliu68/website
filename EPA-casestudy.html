      The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was established in December 1970 by the executive order of President Richard Nixon. 
      It is an agency of the United States federal government <b>whose mission is to protect human and environmental health.</b> 
 <!--       Headquartered in Washington, D.C., the EPA is responsible for creating standards and laws promoting the health of individuals 
      and the environment.<br>From the EPA’s creation, it has sought to protect and conserve the natural environment and improve 
      the health of humans by researching the effects of and mandating limits on the use of pollutants.-->

      but <b>the website was lacking personality and missing a brand voice.</b> Also, <b>the website navigation

      we utilized similarweb to gain some further insight. <b>The website addressed its various target users - universities, 
      news, law and finally education.</b> We also learned that the links on the website are used for easier discoverability. 
      This makes it easier for Google to crawl and find items people are looking for.  <b>The EPA site acts as a giant database 
      for information that people use for research.</b>

          <p class="card-text"> We conducted an open card sort to help us in creating a newly imagined navigation in order to tackle 
            the information architecture and structure first.  Utilizing this method we were able to synthesize 
            our navigation from 30 items down to 15, cutting it in half and featuring what was important according

            descriptions.  We found that the site had done a good job with accessibility, but it was still 
            lacking in a brand voice and an approachable feel.  Our goal was to keep in line with accessibility

    <h3>User Testing and Key Findings</h3>

  <div class="container px-lg-5">
    <p class="font-weight-normal">Since we wanted to validate and iterate on our designs, our next step was to test our 
      low-fidelity prototype with users that fit our target audience. We created a user testing plan, in which we had laid out 
      3 tasks for the users to perform.</p>
    <div class="col-me-8 py-3 px-lg-5"><img src="images/user-testing.png" class="mx-auto d-block img-fluid" alt="Responsive image"></div>

  <div class="container px-lg-5">
    <p class="font-weight-normal">Overall users like the color scheme, images and design system on the new website. It was 
      straight forward for the users to finish the first task of finding the Earth Day activity. For the second task, all 
      the user went to “My Community” section to look for information about “Mold” and then they will look under the 
      “Environmental Topics” and found the topic about “mold”. So the problem goes back to the sitemap and need to rework 
      the sitemap and user flow in order to fix the user confusion.

      screens and moved on to the high-fidelity phase. In this we were going to add a visual layer to our wires and bring the 
      product to life. Here is a small sample of the newly created prototype complete with beautiful images, newly created content 
      and clearer calls to action. This was our first iteration due to time constraints, however, it clearly shows the direction 
      and feel of the rebrand and redesign we created.

    <h3>Key Learning and Takeaways</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="container px-lg-5">
    <p class="font-weight-normal">It was a challenge to restructure the current website and unify the content, apply the new UI elements 
      under a new brand vision. The content structure can make or break a user experience as we tried to chunk the content and use the 
      cards as a secondary navigation, hence to enable our users to scan the page quickly. Tackling the responsive web design can be very challenging,
      how can we enhance our users experiences makes this project a valuable exercise in responsive web design. As a UX/UI  
      designers, when designing for any digital content, it should be accessible across different platforms and orientations.
